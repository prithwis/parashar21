## Casting and analysis of horoscopes on the basis of Hindu-Indic principles

# What is Parashar21
Parashar21 is a design or strategy, along with a collection of programs, that are used to 
1. Read a very minimal set of data that define a horoscope, provided in csv file [like this](https://github.com/prithwis/parashar21/blob/main/data/Test5Data.txt) that has data about 5 people.
2. Use this data to build a richer and more detailed horoscope and convert it into a JSON  object
3. Store the horoscopes (or JSON objects) in both (a) a MongoDB database and (b) a txt file
4. Retrieve horoscopes from the MongoDB database based on values of data stored in the fields
5. Generate horoscope charts in one of three styles, namely Bengal, North India and South India
6. Generate a report that gives detailed information about the horoscopes.
7. Store the report in a MS Word doc file. [Samples shown here](https://github.com/prithwis/parashar21/tree/main/Sample%20Reports%202)
